# US Bikeshare data

This small python app gets some neat data from a US Bikeshare database.

## How to use it?
Run your python interpreter with Pandas. Sadly, without the CSV files, it cannot be run.

The data is not shared, since it comes from Udacity as part of the Programming for Data Science ND
